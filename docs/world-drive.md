# World Drive (worlddrive.app)

World Drive is the second app in this repository: pick anywhere on Earth from a globe of Google's
photorealistic 3D tiles, drop in and drive the real world, arcade style. It shares `src/` with the
construction app (the tiles, the models, the driving) but has its own page, build, Worker and
address, and the construction app is unchanged by it.

| | Construction app | World Drive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page | `index.html`, `src/main.js` | `drive/index.html`, `src/drive-app/` |
| Build | `npm run build` → `dist/` | `npm run build:drive` → `dist-drive/` |
| Worker | `wrangler.jsonc`, `worker/` | `wrangler.drive.jsonc`, `worker/drive/` |
| Address | `neptune-twin-app` Worker | https://worlddrive.app (and www) |

## Playing

1. **The globe.** It opens on the whole Earth, slowly turning, facing your part of the world (going by
   your clock). Drag to spin it, scroll or pinch to zoom, right-drag or two fingers to tilt.
2. **Pick a place**, any of these ways:
   - **Search** for a place or an address and press Enter (or **Go**). It only searches when you ask,
     never as you type. Typed coordinates (`46.57, 8.42`, or `46.57° N, 8.42° E`) need no search.
   - **Start spots**: a dozen places worth a drive (Neptune Terminals, the Sea-to-Sky Highway, the Lions
     Gate, Golden Gate and Sydney Harbour bridges, Times Square, Monaco, Shibuya, the Furka Pass, the
     Grand Canyon, the Arc de Triomphe and the Las Vegas Strip).
   - **Recent**: the last six places you drove (kept in this browser).
   - **Tap the globe** anywhere to drop a pin.

   Choosing a search result or a spot flies the globe down to it and pins it. The card under the pin
   says where it is, with **Drive here**.
3. **Your ride**: the go-kart, a pickup, a semi or a haul truck. The choice is remembered.
4. **Drive here.** The view flies down to the pin and waits for the ground to load ("Loading the
   ground..."), so the vehicle never drops through tiles that aren't there yet. It starts on the ground
   at the pin, facing along the street if there is one (a spot's road, or the longest clear line
   through the pin), else north. A spot on a bridge, or a search result that is a bridge, starts on the
   deck rather than on the water underneath. A pin on a roof (a search result that's a building's
   middle, or a tap on one) starts on the street beside it, and a start with something right in front
   of it (a car parked in Google's photo, a bollard) moves across the road to a clear lane. Where
   there's nothing at all to drive on, it says so and goes back to the globe.
5. **M** (or the **Globe** button) goes back to the globe, from driving or from a drop-in on its way
   down. Pick somewhere else and drop in again: as often as you like, without reloading.

### Keys

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| W / S | Gas; brake, and reverse once stopped |
| A / D | Steer |
| Space | Hop; hold it round a bend to drift, and let go for a mini-turbo |
| B | Booster |
| Shift | Fly: hold to lift off, let go to glide down |
| R | Stuck? Back on the road a few metres on |
| C | Chase or driver's-seat camera |
| Wheel | Chase camera nearer or farther |
| M | Back to the globe |
| Esc | Pause: keep driving, change ride, or back to the globe |

The keys card shows as each drive starts; **?** brings it back. Flying, the booster, drifts and R come
from `src/drive.js`, which World Drive starts with `fly`, `booster` and `drift` on (the construction
app leaves them off).

On a touch screen the globe's panel is a sheet along the bottom, and driving has on-screen buttons
(the driving HUD's, `src/drive-hud.js`): steering bottom left; **Gas** with **Drift** over it at the
right-hand edge, and **Brake**, **Boost** and **Fly** beside them; reset (↺) and **Cam** at the top
right, under the bar with **Globe** and pause. Several can be held at once.

## What a visit costs, and how it's capped

Google bills the Map Tiles API by the **3D tiles session**: each page that loads the root tileset
starts one. World Drive is built so that one page load is one session, however much you fly about:

- The root tileset is requested once per page load. **Drive here** doesn't load a new world: it moves
  the one already loaded so the new place is at the scene's centre (`recentreTiles` in `src/world.js`,
  the same transform `ReorientationPlugin` makes when the tiles arrive), and keeps the camera where it
  was on the Earth (`GlobeView.capture` / `restore`). Tiles already loaded stay loaded.
- The tiles' session isn't renewed by itself (`autoRefreshToken: false`): renewing would be a new
  billed session. After a few hours on one page, Google ends the session; World Drive then says to
  reload, which counts as a new visit.
- The built site never contains the Maps key. The page asks the Worker for it once as it starts
  (`POST /api/visit`), after an invisible Cloudflare Turnstile check, and only while the day's visits
  are under two caps: **DAILY_VISITS** for everyone together (300) and **PER_VISITOR_DAILY** for each
  visitor (8). Both start again at midnight UTC.
- Over a cap the page shows **Today's free drives are used up**, with how long until fresh drives,
  and loads nothing from Google. A failed robot check shows **We couldn't check you're a person**
  with **Try again**. With no key set, it shows **World Drive is getting ready** (with a flat test pad
  to drive, which costs nothing).

A visitor is a hash of their IP address with a random salt made each day; addresses are never
stored, and each day's salt and counts are deleted when the next day starts. Both caps are counted in
one Durable Object (`worker/drive/limits.js`, on SQLite storage, which every plan has), so two
visits at once can't both take the last drive.

The key still reaches the browser (that's how the tiles are fetched), so someone determined could copy
it from a visit. That's what the Google-side limits below are for: the key only works from
worlddrive.app, only for the Map Tiles API, and only up to a daily quota.

### Search

`GET /api/search?q=` passes the search to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim under its usage policy: World Drive
names itself in the User-Agent (`WorldDrive/1.0 (+https://worlddrive.app)`), sends at most one request
a second from everyone together (a busier queue gets "try again in a moment"), keeps each answer in
Cloudflare's cache for a day (by the tidied query, so `Furka  Pass` and `furka pass` are one lookup),
answers only with `{ name, lat, lon, type }`, and refuses queries over 120 characters or with
anything but letters, numbers and an address's punctuation. The globe's panel shows
"Search © OpenStreetMap contributors".

## Settings

In `wrangler.drive.jsonc` (`vars`, set on every deploy; change them there, not in the dashboard):

| Setting | Default | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DAILY_VISITS` | 300 | Visits a day for everyone together; 0 closes for the day |
| `PER_VISITOR_DAILY` | 8 | Visits a day per visitor |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | `0x4AAAAAAFs3k5sgUIQHSuGC` | The worlddrive.app Turnstile widget (public) |

Secrets, set by the owner and never in a file (Cloudflare dashboard: Workers & Pages → world-drive →
Settings → Variables and Secrets, or `npx wrangler secret put NAME -c wrangler.drive.jsonc`):

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | The Maps key from World Drive's own Google Cloud project (below). A secret named `Google_maps_api`, in any case, is taken too. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | The Turnstile widget's secret key |

`keep_vars` is on, so anything set in the dashboard that isn't in `vars` survives a deploy.

## Deploying

`npm run deploy:drive` builds the site into `dist-drive/` and deploys the `world-drive` Worker with
it (`vite build --config vite.drive.config.js && wrangler deploy -c wrangler.drive.jsonc`). The
Worker only runs for `/api/*`; every other file is served straight from Cloudflare's assets.

To deploy from GitHub on every push with Workers Builds (as the construction app is): in the
Cloudflare dashboard open the **world-drive** Worker → Settings → Build, connect this repository and
set

- Build command: `npm run build:drive`
- Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy -c wrangler.drive.jsonc`
- Branch: the branch World Drive ships from

The first deploy replaces the holding page. `worlddrive.app` and `www.worlddrive.app` are the Worker's
custom domains (`routes` in `wrangler.drive.jsonc`; Cloudflare makes their DNS records and
certificates). `www` sends you on to `worlddrive.app` with the path kept. There's no `workers.dev`
address: the Turnstile widget only works on worlddrive.app, and one address keeps the counts simple.

## The owner's Google Cloud steps

Keep World Drive's key apart from the construction app's, so its limits and its bill are its own:

1. **A separate project.** In the Google Cloud console, create a project (e.g. "World Drive") on your
   billing account.
2. **Only the Map Tiles API.** APIs & Services → Library → **Map Tiles API** → Enable. Nothing else
   needs to be on.
3. **A key, restricted.** APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key, then edit it:
   - Application restrictions: **Websites**, with `https://worlddrive.app/*` and
     `https://www.worlddrive.app/*`. (A copied key then doesn't work from other sites.)
   - API restrictions: **Restrict key** → **Map Tiles API** only.
4. **A daily quota cap.** APIs & Services → Map Tiles API → **Quotas & system limits**: lower the
   per-day limit on 3D Tiles root tileset requests (the sessions) to a little over `DAILY_VISITS`,
   e.g. 350, and the per-day limit on 3D tile requests to a sensible multiple of that (a long drive
   loads a few thousand tiles). The console's names for these change now and then: look for the
   per-day ones. It's the backstop if the key is copied and used from somewhere the referrer check
   doesn't stop; once a limit is reached, tiles stop loading until midnight Pacific time rather than
   costing more.
5. **Budget alerts.** Billing → Budgets & alerts → Create budget for the World Drive project, with
   email alerts at, say, 50 %, 90 % and 100 % of what you're happy to spend a month. Check Google's
   current [Map Tiles API pricing](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing)
   and its monthly free allowance to choose `DAILY_VISITS` and the budget together.
6. **Give the key to the Worker:** `npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY -c wrangler.drive.jsonc`
   (or the dashboard). The globe comes on at the next page load; no deploy needed.

## Turnstile

The widget for worlddrive.app already exists (site key above, its secret is `TURNSTILE_SECRET`). The
page runs it invisibly (`appearance: 'interaction-only'`): most people never see it; if Turnstile
wants a click, the widget shows on the start screen. The Worker checks each token once with
Turnstile's siteverify, with the visitor's IP address, before counting the visit. For local testing,
use Turnstile's test keys (in `.dev.vars.drive.example`): site key `1x00000000000000000000AA` with
secret `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` always passes; secret
`2x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` always fails.

## Trying it on your computer

- `npm run dev:drive` serves World Drive at http://localhost:5173/. With a Maps key in the
  environment (the names `vite.config.js` reads, e.g. `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) it drives on Google's
  tiles directly, without the Worker; without one, it shows a test globe and a flat test pad wherever
  you drop in, so everything but the real world can be tried at no cost. The key is only ever taken
  into the dev server, never into `npm run build:drive`, whose build fails if it finds it in the
  output.
- With the Worker: copy `.dev.vars.drive.example` to `.dev.vars.drive`, run `npm run dev:drive-api`
  (the Worker on http://localhost:8790), and `DRIVE_API=http://localhost:8790 npm run dev:drive`. The
  page then goes through the robot check (Turnstile's test keys), the caps and the real search.
  Small caps there make the used-up screen easy to see.
- In the browser console, `window.drive` has the scene, the globe, the driver and `dropIn( { name,
  lat, lon } )`.

Tests: `npm run test:drive-worker` (the Worker under `wrangler dev`, with stand-ins for Turnstile and
Nominatim: the caps, their reset at midnight UTC, Turnstile passing and failing, same-origin and JSON
checks, the search's validation, cache and one-a-second limit, www, and that the key is only ever in
the answer to a visit that passed) and `npm run test:drive-ui` (the page in Chromium without a key:
the globe and panel, search on Enter, spots, pins, dropping in and driving, changing ride, M and
teleporting again without a reload, recent places, a phone with touch buttons, and the used-up,
robot-check and getting-ready screens).

## How it fits together

```
drive/index.html             the page: panel, pin card, driving bar, keys card, screens
src/drive-app/main.js        starts it: the visit, the tiles, modes (globe, dropping, driving,
                             paused), dropping in, recentring, the render loop
src/drive-app/globe.js       GlobeView: GlobeControls, the slow spin, flights, the pin, picking
src/drive-app/spawn.js       Ground: the ground's height, which way the street runs, a bridge's deck
src/drive-app/panel.js       search, spots, recent places, the ride picker, the pin's card
src/drive-app/places.js      the start spots, typed coordinates, recent places
src/drive-app/vehicles.js    the go-kart and the library trucks; catalog.js lists which
src/drive-app/api.js         /api/config, the visit with Turnstile, /api/search
src/drive-app/screens.js     start screen, notices, loading card, pause, keys, messages
src/drive-app/test-globe.js  the Earth without Google's tiles, for working without a key
vite.drive.config.js         the build: no key, only the offered vehicles copied from public/
worker/drive/                the Worker: index.js (routes), limits.js (caps and the search queue),
                             turnstile.js, search.js
wrangler.drive.jsonc         the Worker's settings, domains and Durable Object
```

Shared modules take World Drive's place as a parameter, with the terminal as the default:
`createGoogleTiles( { site } )` and `recentreTiles` in `src/world.js`, and the `site` argument of
`localToLatLon` / `latLonToEnu` in `src/geo.js`.

## Known limits

- Where Google has no photogrammetry, the 3D tiles are smooth terrain with imagery on it: it still
  drives, without buildings.
- From far away only Google's coarsest tiles have loaded; heights read off them are ignored, and the
  pin and the flight down settle onto the ground as sharper tiles arrive.
- The search is only as good as OpenStreetMap's: a result is a point, which may be a building's middle
  rather than its street. Dropping in starts on the street beside it (within about 50 m) and faces
  along it; a big flat roof (a line 30 m long across it) counts as somewhere to drive.
- Collisions with Google's mesh are as good as the mesh: thin railings may not stop you (the kart can
  drift through the Lions Gate's railing and drop off the deck), and parked cars and trees in the
  photo are solid lumps.
- Flying over a valley, the glide down (3 m/s) can take a while: R puts you back on the road.
